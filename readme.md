Laravel
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. The creators of Laravel believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching. Laravel will be used in our web application to create a RESTFUL API that serves as the backend to our application. This backend will allow us to do the basic CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for our hamburgers and their descriptions

AngularJS
AngularJS is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and by a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications. AngularJS will be used as the frontend for our application.

Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile first front-end framework for faster and easier web development. Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web sites. Bootstrap will be used to make our web application pretty J Hey, I’m vain and looks matter to me.
